# Opinion Dynamics meet Agent-based Climate Economics: An Integrated Analysis of Carbon Taxation
This repository contains the NetLogo source code, data and scenarios of the paper "Opinion Dynamics meet Agent-based Climate Economics: An Integrated Analysis of Carbon Taxation" [Add DOI once available].

## Usage
The file "OD model.nlogo" contains the opinion dynamics model. For calibration, the model requries empirical data as input which are collected in the folder "Calibration".  
To replicate opinion dynamics of the 133 policy scenarios combining different carbon tax schemes and revenue recycling mechanisms, the model requires empirical data to initialize households and scenario-specific outputs of the DSK integrated assessment model which are collected in the folder "Policy scenarios".
